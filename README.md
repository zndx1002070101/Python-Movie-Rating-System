# Python-Movie-Rating-System

In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis in this article â€” a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth reading.

Fandango displays a 5-star rating system on their website, where the minimum rating is 0 stars and the maximum is 5 stars.

* The actual rating was almost always rounded up to the nearest half-star. For instance, a 4.1 movie would be rounded off to 4.5 stars, not to 4 stars, as you may expect.
* In the case of 8% of the ratings analyzed, the rounding up was done to the nearest whole star. For instance, a 4.5 rating would be rounded off to 5 stars.
* For one movie rating, the rounding off was completely bizarre: from a rating of 4 in the HTML of the page to a displayed rating of 5 stars.
